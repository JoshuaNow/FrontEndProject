# The Dining Room

## Project Overview :wine_glass:

We created a website design emulating a drink and dining lifestyle page.

Two different APIs were used to pull data onto the website. The first API provides top dining articles from The New York Times and the second generates random cocktail recipes.

## Languages

This project was created using the following languages:

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

Our team practiced manipulating both APIs through JavaScript, along with DOM manipulation. We created our website without the use of frameworks to flex our HTML and CSS knowledge.

We hope you enjoy viewing our project!
